## About `telegram.sh`
The `telegram.sh` script manages the lifecycle of the Telegram Desktop application. It:

- **Launches Telegram Desktop**: Starts the application and tracks its process ID (PID).
- **Monitors the Application**: Continuously checks if the Telegram window remains open using `wmctrl`.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Automatically terminates the Telegram process when the window is closed.

This script ensures a clean and controlled execution of Telegram Desktop, making it ideal for containerized environments.

## About `xdg-open-hook.sh`
The `xdg-open-hook.sh` script ensures safe handling of `xdg-open` calls made by Telegram Desktop in the container. It:
- Validates and forwards URL requests to the host systemâ€™s browser.
- Logs or rejects unsafe or unsupported file and link requests.
- Prevents unintended execution of commands, enhancing security.

This script ensures seamless integration with the host system while maintaining container isolation.

## Requirements
