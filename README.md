# Telegram Desktop in Docker

## Overview
This project allows running **Telegram Desktop** inside a Docker container to enhance security and isolation. It helps protect your system from potential threats by isolating the application while maintaining full functionality.

Tested with Telegram 6.0.2

---

## Features
- **Isolation**: Runs Telegram Desktop in a secure containerized environment.
- **Security**: Limits access to system resources.
- **Flexibility**: Supports X11/Wayland for GUI display.
- **Compatibility**: Easy integration with host system for data persistence.
- **Safe Link Handling**: Includes a hook for secure URL and file handling.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kvakirsanov/docker-telegram-desktop.git
cd docker-telegram-desktop
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image
amd64 host:
```bash
./build.sh
```

arm64 host (buildx):
```bash
./buildx.sh
```

### 3. Run Telegram Desktop
```bash
./run.sh
```

## About `scripts/telegram.sh`
The `telegram.sh` script manages the lifecycle of the Telegram Desktop application inside Docker container. It:

- **Launches Telegram Desktop**: Starts the application and tracks its process ID (PID).
- **Monitors the Application**: Continuously checks if the Telegram window remains open using `wmctrl`.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Automatically terminates the Telegram process when the window is closed.

This script ensures a clean and controlled execution of Telegram Desktop, making it ideal for containerized environments.

## About `scripts/xdg-open-hook.sh`
The `xdg-open-hook.sh` script ensures safe handling of `xdg-open` calls made by Telegram Desktop in the container. It:
- Validates and forwards URL requests to the host systemâ€™s browser.
- Logs or rejects unsafe or unsupported file and link requests.
- Prevents unintended execution of commands, enhancing security.

This script ensures seamless integration with the host system while maintaining container isolation.

## Requirements
- Docker (20.x or higher).
- X11 or Wayland support for graphical output.

### TODO
- **Isolate X Server**: Implement X server isolation using tools like [x11docker](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker).
- **Replace `xhost`**: Use more secure alternatives, such as `xhost +si:localuser:$(whoami)` or virtual X servers like `Xvfb`.
- **Add Wayland Support**: Explore Wayland as a modern and secure alternative to X11.
- **Limit Docker Privileges**: Audit and restrict container permissions for enhanced security.
- **Automate Setup**: Create scripts for seamless integration with x11docker or other isolation tools.
